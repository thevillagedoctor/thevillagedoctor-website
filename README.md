# thevillagedoctor-website

This is a website "reboot" for thevillagedoctor.net

The original site was built using an adobe program that is no longer supported.  I downloaded the files from cPannel before launching the new site and saved them in the respository "thevillagedoctor-original-website" incase any aspedt of them is needed in the future. 

This site was built using React (TypeScript), HTML5, and CSS3.  

Certain aspects of the site are designed to be easily modified by the client.  This includes the hours, insurance companies, and resource page.  This is done using fetch() to access information from txt files.  So when the client updates the txt file (via cPannel), the information on the live site should update.
