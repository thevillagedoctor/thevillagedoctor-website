We are now able to accept card payments online. The link below will take you to a safe off-site page owned by our payment vendor. You will need to complete the information, including your patient number, on the first page and then you will be taken to the payment page. Please note, you can still pay your bill via mail (card or check) and in the office (card, cash, check, or apple/google pay).
