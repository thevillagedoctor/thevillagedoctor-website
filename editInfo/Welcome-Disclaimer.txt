Please note, that due to COVID-19, there have been some changes made to the waiting room. The toys and other "high-touch" items have temporarily been removed to ensure the safest possible experience for our patients. We also make an effort to bring each patient back to a sanitized exam room as soon as they check in, so no one is spending too much time in the common area. Our normal waiting room will return once we are comfortable all of our patients will be safe.
