Welcome new patients!

Please use the button below to complete the registration process. (If you are not able to do this on line, please call the office and we can get you started.) Here you will also find the membership contract and other New Patient paperwork that you can conveniently complete on line. If you would like to preview the contract before signing up, you can access that below as well. We look forward to meeting you.

As a member of the practice, you can schedule an appointment to be seen during our normal office hours. For routine visits, please call the office to set up an appointment that best matches your schedule. When urgent problems come up unexpectedly we can almost always see you within one business day. Unless you have a life-threatening emergency, it is always better for you to come here, where we know you, rather than going to the urgent care or emergency room.

We value your time, and we make special efforts to keep to our scheduled appointment times. In order to do this, we ask you to arrive at the office 15 minutes before your appointment so that we can have you in the room and ready to see the doctor as close to your appointment time as possible.
