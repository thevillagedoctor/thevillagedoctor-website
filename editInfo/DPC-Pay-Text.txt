We provide the broadest care possible from our office, so that it is covered by your membership fee. There are several types of care that we cannot provide directly, however. This includes specialty care, physical therapy services, ER or urgent care visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries.

In addition, prescriptions, imaging (e.g., x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs), and most laboratory tests – things that we cannot do in our office – are not included. However, we are working to provide each member with access to low-cost options for these diagnostic and treatment services.

It is important for everyone to make their own assessment on how to best access both primary care and specialty or emergency care.
