As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) practice, we do not participate with any insurance companies. Rather than billing you or your insurance for each visit, there is a set, monthly fee for patients to be a member of the practice. The fee will give you access to Dr. Grimm for all of the scheduled visits that you need to help you meet your healthcare goals – whether they are in person, through video conference, or by phone. You will have free access to classes that the practice develops to address common health concerns. You will have access to Dr. Grimm and The Village Doctor’s staff by phone during regular office hours, through the portal (online) anytime, and through after-hours phone access at all times for urgent issues or emergencies.
