Dr. Ken Grimm is board certified in Family Medicine. He grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but has made Michigan his home since 1994. He lives in Cherry Hill Village, less than one mile from the practice, where he and his wife raised their two children. His bachelor's degree is from The Johns Hopkins University, and his medical degree is from the University of Pennsylvania. He completed his residency at the University of Michigan, where he served as chief resident in his final year. He has been in practice in the area since 1997. He has taught medical students from both the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, as well as residents at Crestwell Medical (formerly Oakwood and Beaumont), St Mary Mercy Hospital, and Providence Hospital.

Dr. Grimm believes his role is to be a partner with his patients in their health care. He is an advisor, offering medical facts and expert opinions to his patients, allowing them to make their own best, most informed decisions regarding their healthcare.

Dr. Grimm has a special interest in Preventive Medicine, realizing that it is far better to prevent a disease or a complication from happening than to manage it later. He is an expert in the science of Preventive Medicine. He can offer you advice on what the latest research has taught us, and how it applies to your personal preventive health plan.

Dr. Grimm believes deeply in the model of the true Family Doctor, where patients and their families have a personal relationship with their physician, who is there to help them with all of their healthcare needs comprehensively and continuously. This has, unfortunately, become rare in healthcare today. If that is something that you value too, you can find it here. This is what we mean by evidence-based medicine, old-fashioned care.
