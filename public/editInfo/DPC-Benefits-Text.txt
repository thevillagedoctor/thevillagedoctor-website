Whether you know it or not, your care has likely been hindered by the ever-increasing rules of insurance companies. At a minimum, the need to see more patients in order to cover basic practice costs – like rent and staff salaries – means that you have had less time with your providers. With the DPC model, we can spend an hour with you – addressing your concerns thoroughly and in an individualized way. This is the way that medical care was meant to be provided – without tight schedules and wondering if the treatment that is best for you will be covered by your insurance. We will be able to provide classes or one-on-one education that can be critical in managing complex problems like diabetes, obesity, and depression. Members of DPC practices are less likely to be referred to a specialist since the primary care doctor has time to discuss options with the patient, consult with the specialist, and then implement treatment.
