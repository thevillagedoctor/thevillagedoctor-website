You can schedule an appointment to be seen during our normal office hours. For routine visits, please call in advance so we can give you an appointment that best matches your schedule. When urgent problems come up unexpectedly we will do our best to see you within one business day. Unless you have a life-threatening emergency, it is always better for you to see a medical provider who knows you, rather than going to the urgent care or emergency room.

We value your time, and we make special efforts to keep to our scheduled appointment times. In order to do this, we ask you to arrive at the office 15 minutes before your appointment so that we can have you in the room and ready to see the doctor as close to your appointment time as possible.
