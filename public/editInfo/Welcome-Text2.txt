What is Direct Primary Care? It is an innovative way to experience an old-fashioned relationship with your doctor. Since The Village Doctor opened its doors in 2012, we have prided ourselves in providing patient-focused care – including longer appointments, 24/7 physician access, and a practice that sees our patients as partners. However, the current, insurance-based medical system that has developed in the US often serves as a barrier to the goal of developing a strong doctor-patient relationship. Your healthcare decisions should be made based on a conversation between you and your doctor – taking into account the best evidence-based medicine and your personal goals – and not by an insurance company. Direct Primary Care allows us to return to providing care in a way that makes the most sense for you and your family.
