The Village Doctor at Cherry Hill was established in 2012 by Dr. Ken Grimm. We are located at the entrance to Cherry Hill Village, a beautiful neighborhood on the west side of Canton. Our goal is to provide outstanding primary care medical services to the people of the Village, Canton, and the surrounding areas.

Here, we still believe in the personal relationship that you and your family have with your doctor! We want to get to know you individually because that helps us to offer you the most appropriate care. 

Our practice can be an extension of your family! Whether you are healthy and seeking advice on maximizing wellness, or you need a partner in managing chronic medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or depression, you will find what you are looking for here.

We care for patients of all ages, from "cradle to grave". Whether you are a mother with a newborn or a son with an elderly parent, we are trained and ready to help you and your family with your health care needs. We provide women's health services, well-child care, adolescent medicine, and care for elderly patients. We perform most office-based procedures right here, meaning that you will rarely have to be referred to a doctor you don't know.
